# The Narrative Constitution

This document outlines the principles of high-quality storytelling that guide the reflective and critical processes of the Metacognitive Narrative Engine. It is the source of truth for all Reflector agents.

## Level 1: Structural Integrity (Evaluated by Structural Critic)

| Principle | Rule ID | Rule Description | Guiding Question for Reflector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Causality & Coherence | 1.1 | Every significant plot event must be a plausible cause for subsequent events and/or a plausible effect of preceding events. The narrative must be free of logical contradictions. | Does Event B logically follow from Event A? Is there a clear chain of cause and effect? Does any part of the story contradict another? |
| Pacing & Structure | 1.2 | The narrative should exhibit a recognizable structure (e.g., three-act structure, Freytag's pyramid) with discernible stages like rising action, climax, and falling action. The pacing should vary appropriately to build and release tension. | Does the story build to a clear climax? Is the pacing effective, or does it feel rushed or dragged out? |

## Level 2: Semantic Depth (Evaluated by Thematic Critic)

| Principle | Rule ID | Rule Description | Guiding Question for Reflector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Character Transformation | 2.1 | The protagonist(s) must undergo a meaningful and believable transformation (an "arc") that is directly related to the story's central conflict and resolution. | How has the protagonist changed from the beginning to the end? Is this change earned and consistent with the events of the story? |
| Thematic Consistency | 2.2 | All major plot elements and character actions should serve to explore or illuminate the story's central theme(s) as defined in the MKB. | Does this scene or action contribute to the central theme, or is it extraneous? |
| Character Motivation | 2.3 | All character actions must be consistent with their established psychological profile, core motivations, and desires as defined in their character model. | Why did the character do that? Is this action a believable expression of their established personality and goals? |

## Level 3: Stylistic & Pragmatic Efficacy (Evaluated by Stylistic Critic)

| Principle | Rule ID | Rule Description | Guiding Question for Reflector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focalization & PoV | 3.1 | The narrative perspective must remain consistent with the chosen focalization mode (zero, internal, or external). Information revealed to the reader must not violate the constraints of this mode. | Does the text reveal information that the current focalizing character could not possibly know? Is the narrative voice consistent? |
| Emotional Resonance | 3.2 | The narrative must contain sufficient and effective "stimuli"—sensory details, evocative language, character reactions—to elicit the intended emotional response in a hypothetical reader. | Does this scene effectively create suspense, joy, or sadness? What specific elements contribute to this feeling? |
| Narrative Efficiency | 3.3 | The narrative should prioritize demonstrating plot and character through action, dialogue, and sensory detail ("show") over relying on direct expository summary ("tell"). | Is this information being told to the reader directly when it could be shown through a character's actions or a scene? |

## Level 4: Ethical & Safety Alignment (Evaluated by Ethical Critic)

| Principle | Rule ID | Rule Description | Guiding Question for Reflector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bias & Stereotype Mitigation | 4.1 | The narrative must actively avoid creating or reinforcing harmful stereotypes related to protected attributes such as race, gender, age, disability, religion, or sexual orientation. | Does the portrayal of any character or group rely on lazy or harmful stereotypes? Are diverse characters represented with nuance and individuality? |
| Harmlessness & Safety | 4.2 | The narrative must not contain or endorse gratuitous or glorifying depictions of violence, self-harm, hate speech, or illegal acts. Content must be appropriate for the intended context. | Is the content of this story safe and non-toxic? Does it violate any established safety guidelines? |
| Cultural Sensitivity | 4.3 | The narrative should be evaluated for its potential to be viewed as harmful, offensive, or insensitive from diverse cultural perspectives, particularly non-Western ones. | Could this narrative be misinterpreted or cause offense in a different cultural context? Does it make culturally specific assumptions? |
