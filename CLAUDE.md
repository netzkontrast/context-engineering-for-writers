### 🔄 Writing Awareness & Context
- **Always read `WRITING_PLAN.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the essay's goals, structure, and style requirements.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new writing task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent voice, tone, and structural patterns** as described in `WRITING_PLAN.md`.
- **Reference examples** in the examples/ folder to maintain stylistic consistency.

### ✍️ Writing Philosophy & Approach
- **Clarity above all**: Every sentence should be immediately understandable. If a sentence requires re-reading, rewrite it.
- **Conciseness with depth**: Say more with fewer words. Cut ruthlessly but preserve insight.
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use concrete examples, anecdotes, and specific details to illustrate abstract points.
- **Write like you speak**: Use conversational tone while maintaining intellectual rigor.
- **One idea per paragraph**: Each paragraph should advance a single, clear point.

### 📝 Essay Structure & Flow
- **Hook immediately**: Start with something surprising, counterintuitive, or personally revealing.
- **Build momentum**: Each paragraph should create forward motion toward your conclusion.
- **Use smooth transitions**: Connect ideas naturally without jarring jumps.
- **End with impact**: Conclusions should feel inevitable yet surprising.
- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones.

### 🎯 Style & Voice Conventions
- **Personal but not self-indulgent**: Use "I" when it adds authenticity, avoid when it's unnecessary.
- **Specific over general**: "Three weeks" instead of "recently"; "PostgreSQL" instead of "database."
- **Active voice preferred**: "I discovered" not "It was discovered by me."
- **Avoid academic jargon**: Write for intelligent readers, not specialists.
- **Use metaphors and analogies**: Help readers visualize complex ideas.

### 🔍 Research & Evidence Standards
- **Primary sources preferred**: Link to original research, not summaries.
- **Integrate sources naturally**: Don't just cite; weave evidence into your argument.
- **Balance data with insight**: Statistics support points; they don't make points.
- **Fact-check everything**: Verify claims, especially statistics and quotes.
- **Credit generously**: Acknowledge influences and inspirations.

### 📖 Revision & Quality Control
- **Read aloud**: If it doesn't flow when spoken, rewrite it.
- **Cut unnecessary words**: "In order to" becomes "to"; "the fact that" becomes "that."
- **Check for repetition**: Don't repeat the same point unless for emphasis.
- **Verify logical flow**: Each paragraph should follow naturally from the previous.
- **Test understanding**: Could a smart 16-year-old follow your argument?

### 🎨 Narrative Techniques
- **Start in the middle**: Begin with action or insight, not background.
- **Use concrete details**: "The coffee was cold" not "I was disappointed."
- **Show character through action**: Reveal personality through what people do, not descriptions.
- **Create scenes**: Help readers visualize moments and conversations.
- **Build to revelations**: Structure discoveries and insights for maximum impact.

### ⚡ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't bury the lede**: Put your most interesting point early, not at the end.
- **Avoid weak openings**: Never start with "In today's world" or "Since the beginning of time."
- **Don't over-explain**: Trust your readers' intelligence.
- **Avoid hedge words**: "Perhaps," "maybe," "it seems" weaken your voice.
- **Don't end weakly**: Avoid "In conclusion" or summarizing what you just said.

### 📊 Quality Validation Criteria
Before considering an essay complete, verify:
- **Clarity**: Can each sentence be understood on first reading?
- **Flow**: Does each paragraph lead naturally to the next?
- **Depth**: Do you offer genuine insights, not just observations?
- **Voice**: Is your personality present but not overwhelming?
- **Impact**: Will readers remember this essay tomorrow?
- **Precision**: Is every word necessary and correctly chosen?

### 🔄 Iterative Improvement Process
- **First draft**: Get ideas down without self-editing
- **Second draft**: Focus on structure and flow
- **Third draft**: Refine voice and cut unnecessary words
- **Final pass**: Check facts, fix typos, ensure consistency
- **Read aloud**: Final test for rhythm and clarity

### 📚 Learning from Examples
When studying examples in the examples/ folder:
- **Analyze openings**: How do they grab attention?
- **Track argument flow**: How do they build their case?
- **Note transitions**: How do they connect ideas?
- **Study conclusions**: How do they end with impact?
- **Observe voice**: What makes their writing distinctive?

### 🎯 Task Completion Standards
- **Mark completed sections** in `TASK.md` immediately after finishing them.
- **Add discovered insights** or new angles to `TASK.md` under "Insights During Writing."
- **Update word count targets** if the essay naturally wants to be longer or shorter.
- **Note successful techniques** that could be reused in future essays.

Remember: Great writing feels effortless to read but requires tremendous effort to create. Engineer the context, then let the ideas flow naturally within that structure.
