## ESSAY TOPIC:
Explore how the maker mindset in programming parallels the creative process in painting, using personal anecdotes and concrete examples to argue that both are fundamentally about iterative creation rather than predetermined execution. Challenge the misconception that programming is purely logical while art is purely emotional.

## EXAMPLES:
In the `examples/` folder:
- `examples/paul_graham_style/hackers_painters.md` - Use this as the primary structural and voice model. Note how Graham uses personal experience to build universal insights, his conversational yet authoritative tone, and how he builds arguments through accumulated examples rather than abstract reasoning.
- `examples/argument_structures/parallel_comparison.md` - Follow this pattern for drawing parallels between two seemingly different domains.
- `examples/transitions/smooth_connections.md` - Use these techniques for connecting personal anecdotes to broader insights.

Focus on Graham's technique of starting with personal observation, building to universal principle, and ending with actionable insight.

## RESEARCH:
- Paul Graham's original "Hackers and Painters" essay for reference and inspiration
- Research on creative processes in both programming and visual arts
- Studies on iterative vs. waterfall development methodologies
- Interviews or quotes from programmers who also engage in visual arts
- Historical examples of artists who worked iteratively (sketching, multiple drafts)

## STYLE & TONE:
- **Voice**: Personal and conversational, like Graham - use "I" statements and personal anecdotes
- **Audience**: Intelligent general readers, both technical and non-technical
- **Tone**: Thoughtful and exploratory, with moments of gentle contrarianism
- **Structure**: Build from specific personal experiences to universal insights
- **Length**: 2000-3000 words, allowing for deep exploration without losing focus

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Include at least 2-3 personal anecdotes that illustrate the iterative nature of both programming and painting
- Challenge common stereotypes about both fields without being dismissive
- End with practical implications - what this means for how we think about creativity and work
- Avoid overly technical programming jargon or art terminology
- Maintain the essay's accessibility while preserving intellectual depth
