# Parallel Comparison Argument Structure

This example demonstrates how to build arguments by drawing parallels between two seemingly different domains.

## Pattern: Domain A ↔ Domain B

### Opening Strategy
Start with a surprising connection or challenge a common assumption about the differences between two fields.

**Example Opening:**
"When I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting."

### Building the Parallel
1. **Acknowledge the surface differences** - Show you understand why people see them as different
2. **Identify the deeper similarity** - Reveal the fundamental connection
3. **Use concrete examples** - Illustrate the parallel with specific instances
4. **Address counterarguments** - Handle objections to your parallel

### Structure Template:
1. Personal anecdote establishing the connection
2. Common misconceptions about both domains
3. The deeper truth that connects them
4. Specific examples that prove the parallel
5. Implications of seeing the connection

### Transition Techniques:
- "Both of these images are wrong..."
- "In fact, of all the different types of people I've known..."
- "What X and Y have in common is..."
- "I've found that the best sources of ideas are not..."

### Conclusion Strategy:
End by showing what this parallel reveals about both domains and why it matters for how we think about creativity, work, or life.

## Why This Works:
- Challenges assumptions
- Uses personal experience as evidence
- Builds from specific to universal
- Leaves readers with new perspective
