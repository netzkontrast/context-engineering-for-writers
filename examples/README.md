# Writing Examples Guide

This folder contains exemplary writing samples and structural patterns to guide AI writing assistants in creating high-quality essays.

## How to Use These Examples

### 1. Study Before Writing
Before creating any WRP, spend time analyzing the examples that match your intended style and structure. Look for:
- Opening techniques that hook readers
- Argument progression patterns
- Voice and tone consistency
- Transition methods
- Conclusion strategies

### 2. Reference Specifically in WRPs
Don't just say "write like Paul Graham." Instead, specify:
- "Use the opening strategy from paul_graham_style/hackers_painters.md - start with personal anecdote that challenges assumptions"
- "Follow the parallel comparison structure from argument_structures/parallel_comparison.md"
- "Apply transition techniques from transitions/smooth_connections.md"

### 3. Add Your Own Examples
As you write more essays, add the best ones to this folder. Organize them by:
- **Style categories** (conversational, analytical, narrative)
- **Structural patterns** (comparison, chronological, problem-solution)
- **Specific techniques** (openings, conclusions, transitions)

## Adding New Examples

When you create a great essay, add it to the appropriate folder with:

### 1. The Essay Itself
Full text with clear formatting and structure

### 2. Analysis Document
Create a companion file explaining:
- What makes this essay effective
- Key techniques used
- When to apply this approach
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### 3. Template Extraction
If the essay demonstrates a reusable pattern, create a template showing:
- General structure
- Transition patterns
- Opening/closing strategies
- Variable elements that can be customized

## Quality Standards for Examples

Only include essays that demonstrate:
- **Immediate clarity** - Understandable on first reading
- **Engaging voice** - Distinctive personality that draws readers in
- **Logical flow** - Ideas build naturally toward conclusion
- **Memorable insights** - Readers will remember key points
- **Technical excellence** - Error-free writing and consistent style

## Using Examples in WRPs

### Specific References
Instead of: "Write in Paul Graham's style"
Use: "Follow the opening strategy from paul_graham_style/hackers_painters.md where he starts with a surprising personal anecdote that immediately challenges conventional assumptions"

### Multiple Examples
Combine techniques from different examples:
- Opening strategy from one essay
- Argument structure from another
- Transition techniques from a third
- Conclusion approach from a fourth

### Adaptation Guidelines
Examples are patterns to adapt, not templates to copy:
- Extract the underlying technique
- Apply it to your specific topic
- Maintain your own voice while using proven structures
- Modify patterns to fit your content and audience

Remember: The goal is to learn from masters while developing your own distinctive voice and approach.
