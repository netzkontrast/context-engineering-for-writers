## Quality Assurance Protocol

### Before Considering Complete
The essay must pass ALL of these criteria:

**Immediate Impact**
- Opening paragraph makes reader want to continue
- First few sentences establish clear voice and direction
- Hook is relevant to the main argument, not just attention-grabbing

**Sustained Engagement**
- No paragraph feels like filler or repetition
- Each section advances the overall argument
- Transitions feel natural and necessary

**Intellectual Depth**
- Goes beyond obvious observations
- Challenges conventional thinking appropriately
- Provides actionable or memorable insights

**Technical Excellence**
- Zero grammatical or factual errors
- Consistent voice and tone throughout
- Appropriate length for the topic and audience

### Self-Correction Process
If any validation criteria fail:
1. **Identify specific issues** - What exactly isn't working?
2. **Trace root causes** - Why did this problem occur?
3. **Apply targeted fixes** - Address the underlying issue, not just symptoms
4. **Re-validate** - Check that fixes don't create new problems
5. **Iterate until excellent** - Don't settle for "good enough"

## Success Indicators

### Quantitative Measures
- Meets target word count range from WRP
- Passes all validation criteria checklist
- Contains required elements specified in WRP

### Qualitative Measures
- Feels effortless to read despite complex ideas
- Leaves readers with new perspective or insight
- Demonstrates clear, distinctive voice
- Would be memorable a week after reading

## Output Requirements

1. **Complete essay** meeting all WRP specifications
2. **Brief summary** of key decisions made during writing
3. **Validation report** confirming all criteria were met
4. **Lessons learned** for improving future WRPs or essays

## Risk Management

### Common Failure Points
- **Weak opening**: Failing to hook reader in first paragraph
- **Voice inconsistency**: Shifting between different tones or perspectives
- **Research dumps**: Including facts without integrating them meaningfully
- **Weak conclusions**: Ending with summary instead of insight

### Recovery Strategies
- **If stuck on opening**: Start with the most interesting insight and work backward
- **If voice feels off**: Return to examples and re-read for voice consistency
- **If research feels forced**: Focus on insights first, then find supporting evidence
- **If conclusion feels weak**: Ask "So what?" and answer with broader implications

Remember: The goal is not just to complete an essay, but to create something genuinely worth reading that demonstrates the power of proper context engineering for writing.
